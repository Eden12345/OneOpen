# One Open

This is a three-dimensional digital space that you can explore from a first person perspective using a mouse and keyboard. It was built with the minified [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master) library created by [Mr.doob](https://github.com/mrdoob), along with several awesome modules that you can find in that repo. You can see the credits for those modules in their respective files in my project, the copyright license for the marble image I used is in the textures folder, and you can find the crystal normal I used for the floor, as well as other great texture packs, [here](https://3dtextures.me/author/gendosplace/).
